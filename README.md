With this dashboard, financial data is no longer just numbers on a spreadsheet but a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. Creating this dashboard was a great opportunity to combine my passion for finance and data analytics. This dashboard has enhanced my ability to dive deeper into financial data in providing valuable insights and strategies decisions. Looking forward to learn more about power Bi and apply my skills in real scenarios.
I request you to go through this and please share your valuable thoughts so that I can improve myself. Please let me know if any corrections are to be made.
